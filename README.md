# Day Two Challenge: Stylish Button with Gradient Magic âœ¨

Hey there! Welcome to Day Two of our coding challenge. Today, we're diving into the world of styling with a focus on creating a sleek, gradient-filled button. Let's make it pop and engage users with some visual goodness!

## Challenge Overview

### 1. Gradient Border ðŸŒˆ

Our button is not your average button. It comes with a gradient border that adds a touch of magic. The gradient spans 115 degrees, creating a captivating visual effect around the button.

### 2. Hover State Magic âœ¨

Hovering over the button triggers a transformation! The gradient colors flip horizontally, bringing a dynamic feel. The button also grows slightly in size, inviting users to interact. And hey, the text switches from a cool gray to a crisp white for that extra visual impact.

### 3. Centered Awesomeness ðŸŽ¯

No one likes a button wandering off on its own. We've centered our stylish button right in the middle of the page. It's all about balance and making things look just right!
